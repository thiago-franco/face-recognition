FACEBOOKFACES DATASETS

These are other Facebook datasets to try.

They are taken by students from Facebook using the following processes

- People uplod photos to facebook
- Facebook detects boxes around faces
- These boxes are used to produce the images in these datasets

The idea is that if one would "sell" a face recognizer to Facebook,
it should work off of detections that are alredy given by Facebook.

These are standardized to the same naming convention,
and to be 100x100 unless otherwise stated.

TODO: facebookfaces and facebookfaces-2 may be merged
